Google AdWords Power BI Template



At present, there is an option to connect Google Ad’s live data to Power BI through a Google Analytics linked account. 
However, the number of dimensions and metrics is extremely limited in GA. 
So, exporting the data provides a quick option if you don’t mind just downloading an updated csv/xlsx file to refresh the data. 
 Not a bad option for a monthly or weekly report frequency.
